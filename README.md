# San Francisco Property Investments
This application analyzes the San Francisco housing market in the years 2010 to 2016 to determine if there are any viable investment opportunities.  By analyzing the sales price per square foot and the average gross rents by neighborhood, we are able to compare the potential profits that could be made within the San Francisco rental housing market.  This application can also be used in other rental housing markets throughout the country to find any potential investment properties.
